## Why I Made It
I created this personal website to showcase my portfolio, share my thoughts, and establish a professional online presence. It serves as a platform to connect with others in the tech community and demonstrate my skills and projects.

## How I Made It
This is a full-stack web application built with modern technologies:

### Backend
- **Flask** - Python web framework
